# ✋ Task 4 – Hand Gesture Recognition with Classical ML

This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.

---

## 🧠 Objective

Develop a hand gesture recognition model that can classify different hand gestures from image data using classical Machine Learning (SVM).

The goal is to enable gesture-based interaction systems using image classification.

---

## 🗂 Dataset

Dataset: **LeapGestRecog** from Kaggle  
Each subfolder (`00` to `09`) contains multiple gesture categories with image frames.  
Data is organized into gesture class folders with grayscale hand images.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – for reading images
- **NumPy** – for array handling
- **Scikit-learn** – for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

---

## 📂 Project Files

- `hand_gesture_model.py` – Main script to:
  - Load and preprocess gesture images
  - Train an SVM classifier
  - Print evaluation report

- `README.md` – This file.

---

## 📈 Output Example

The final output includes:
- Accuracy and classification report for different gesture labels
- Hand gesture classification using traditional ML
